# azure-cost-analysis
This project analyzes anonymized Azure cloud cost data to uncover trends, identify high-impact services, and detect potential optimization opportunities. Using SQL for data exploration and Tableau for interactive dashboards, the analysis focuses on spend distribution, regional patterns, service volatility, and Pareto-driven prioritization.

The final dashboard is built to support stakeholders in understanding cost behavior and driving smarter cloud strategy decisions.
